## ECommerce Startup Database Analysis 

This repository consists of some of the assignments and project questions I’ve done by taking an advanced online SQL course. 

By exploring the database and **writing multi-step SQL queries to work on real-world eCommerce use cases**, I’ve improved MySQL Workbench Skills, gained a deeper understanding of **leveraging SQL data analysis to help shape the performance and direction of business** and, solidified digial marketing domain knowledge particuarly **Web Analytics**.

* Working as an eCommerce Database Analyst for a start-up online retailer. 
* Exploring the database with multiple tables containing data about website activity, orders and products.
* Tackling the assignments and projects structured in way that follow the life of the company in chronological order. 
* Extracting and analyzing data using SQL to help Marketing and Website Managers to steer the business in:



### [1. Traffic Analysis & Optimization](https://github.com/phphoebe/ecommerce-database-analysis/blob/master/1-Traffic%20Analysis%20%26%20Optimization.pdf) 
* Identify top volume and high-converting traffic 
* Understand traffic segments to optimize marketing budgets
* Analyze channel mix for cross-channel bid optimization
* Analyze direct, organic, and brand-driven traffic 

### [2. Website Measurement and Testing](https://github.com/phphoebe/ecommerce-database-analysis/blob/master/2-Website%20Performance%20Analysis.pdf) 
* Identify top website pages & top entry pages
* Analyze landing page performance & A/B testing 
* Analyzing & Testing conversion funnels 

### [3. Business Patterns and Seasonality](https://github.com/phphoebe/ecommerce-database-analysis/blob/master/3-Analyzing%20Business%20Patterns%20%26%20Seasonality.pdf) 
* Analyze seasonal trends for demand forecasting and planning
* Analyze hourly and daily volume to support customer service decisions

### [4. Product-Level Analysis](https://github.com/phphoebe/ecommerce-database-analysis/blob/master/4-Product-Level%20Analysis.pdf)
* Analyze impact of new product launch
* Analyze product-level website pathing
* Cross-sell & product portfolio Analysis
* Product refund analysis

### [5. User-Level Analysis](https://github.com/phphoebe/ecommerce-database-analysis/blob/master/5-User-Level%20Analysis.pdf)
* Identify repeat visitors
* Analyze time to repeat 
* Analyze repeat channel

### Takeaways:
* Think proactively as an analyst to figure out what metrics to use to judge performance for a specific field. 
* Use CTEs to perform multi-step “data program” analyses. Map out each step needed to get to the answer.
* Slice data in segments (e.g. desktop vs. mobile) to continue to look for ways for performance optimization. 
* Conduct time-series or trend analysis to monitor impact of change (e.g. bid adjust or new page/product launch). 
* Use Pageview URL (similar to "Page Title" in GA) to build conversion funnels to analyze CTRs for each step.
* Use Inequality Join and DATEDIFF Function to analyze repeat customer behavior and repeat channel performance.
* Leverage MIN/MAX and Inequality Join to identify the first/most recent data points of auto-increment values. 
* For A/B split tests, limit time periods to where both versions were live to ensure fair comparison.
